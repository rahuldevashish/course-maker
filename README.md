# course-maker
An app for the self learners to keep track of the classes, training videos, books, workshops, etc. Course Maker is a web based application, built with React/Redux persists data on a Mongo database. 

##Description
There's a massive skills migration towards coding and learning tech in general. Many people find a variety of resources to learn but need a place to keep track of them. CourseMaker allows a self-learner to keep records of the material they've used to learn programming. 

[Course Maker][] aspires to show proof that education in a non-traditional class setting is valuable for ones professional growth. 

##What I'm working with
1. React
2. Redux
3. Node
4. MongoDB
5. ESLint

##Roadmap
1. UI
  - A standard form that describes the properties of a course - Name, Author, link to website or book store, etc.
2. User Profile
  - A simple sign up/sign in flow, where users can store courses to their account. In future versions, I plan to add a sign up/sign in process with 3rd parties like Google, Facebook, Github, etc.
3. Database
  - MongoDB to store user profiles and their courses.
4. Deploy to Heroku - [Course Maker][]

##Getting Started
1. Clone repo to your machine
2. Ensure that you have Node and MongoDB installed on your machine
3. Run the following commands:
  - 'npm install'
